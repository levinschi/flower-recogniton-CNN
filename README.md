Flower Recognition using Convolutional Neural 
Networks
Overview
This project aims to classify flower images into five distinct categories: daisy, 
tulip, dandelion, rose, and sunflower. The dataset consists of 4242 images of 
flowers (320x240 pixels), which are used to train and evaluate a Convolutional 
Neural Network (CNN) model built with Python.
Objective
The primary objective is to develop a machine learning model capable of 
accurately identifying flower types based on their images. The model is trained 
to learn unique features of each flower category and make precise predictions 
on unseen test data.
Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model is available on Kaggle here. 
It comprises high-quality flower images categorized into five classes, each 
labelled with its respective flower type.
Technologies Used
• Programming Language: Python
• Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib
• Machine Learning Algorithms: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN
